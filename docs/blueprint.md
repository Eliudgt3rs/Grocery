## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant Green (#50C878) reflecting freshness and the essence of organic groceries.
- Background color: Soft off-white (#F4FDF6), to offer a clean, modern, and airy feel.
- Accent color: Earthy Yellow (#DAA520) to highlight important call-to-action buttons and special offers.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, machined look that supports readability and a clean user interface.
- Use modern, outline-style icons for categories and interactive elements to provide a consistent visual language. These icons will primarily be in the primary and accent colors.
- The layout should focus on a grid system for product listings to ensure the page is easily scannable. Employ full-width banners for promotional offers and seasonal highlights to catch the user's eye.
- Incorporate subtle animations such as fade-ins on image load, smooth scrolling, and animated icons on button hover to improve the user experience. Animations should be short to maintain responsiveness and avoid distractions.
